To experimentally evaluate the effect of the squeeze-excitation (SE) mechanism in the enhancement network, the following table compares the text recognition accuracy with the proposed residual enhancement model and two variants that employ no squeeze-excitation operation in the enhancement network.

Specifically,
(1) The model 'Pooling' removes the SE operation (except its first global average pooling layer) from the global context (GC) block.
(2) The model 'Pooling + FC' replaces the layers in the SE operation after the first pooling layer with a fully connected layer that performs a linear transformation between its input and output of the same size.

SE helps increase the final recognition accuracy on most datasets, showing its ability to adaptively select effective features to better depict the global context information exploited in computing image enhancement representations.
